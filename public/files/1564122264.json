But in my opinion for MongoDb and sockets node.js will be better than PHP.Why? MongoDB using JSON format and NodeJS is javascript server so it is better to handle JSON. Also NodeJS have non-blocking IO so it will be faster for socket than PHP. You can read more Here. NodeJS is very simple to learn.\n\n*Use PHP with sockets *\n\nYou don't need to start new node.js server if you have alredy PHP. You can use library similar to socket.io. Lets check: Elephant IO\n\n*Use PHP for API and Node for socket only *\n\nI think you don't need to use all data from API for socket. So you can create node server only for sockets calls and PHP server for API calls..","user_id":"5d3537b1a042710948001043","question_id":"5d353414a04271008c0039c3"}
